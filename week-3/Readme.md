Social Activity: Dice Math 

Introduce yourself to other kids at your table!  If you have more than 3 kids in a group, you can ask for a 2nd dice bag.  

Shake the dice in the bag

Use the 6-sided dice to create math equations that equal (or  comes closest to) the product of the 12-sided dice.  Look at the .jpg for examples.

Score ‘zero’ for if you make an ‘equal’ equation using all 5 dice (see examples)             
Add points for every point away
7 X 9 is 3 more than 6 X 5 X 2 X 1 X 1  
and would add 3 to your score
