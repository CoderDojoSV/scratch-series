CoderDojo Scratch Series week 5
========================

Ice Breaker: Dogde 'Em!  http://github.com/CoderDojoSV/scratch-series/week-5/DodgeEm.pdf


I appreciate your feedback from the survey!  Let's do it again!<br>
I would love continued feedback: http://goo.gl/tcZRB3

We'll continue some development of last week's project of a platform game. <br>
We made it through Steps 1-3, so I will not include as much detail on this readme.

What did we do last week?<br>
1) an interesting background.  <br>
This week, I changed it to something more compatible with St Patrick's Day

2) A physics engine including ground and gravity.<br>
We looked at my gravity system, and later tonight, I'll show one with more features.

3) adding in boost-by-keys<br>
Some added right/left keys.  Some might want to change the way up arrow boosts.

We finished here last week, and I'll add a bit more now<br>
4) adding in something to collide with.  Coins<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18684721<br>
Scoring is done by object (i.e. the coin) we collide with.  

Topic: 3d art: Want to know how I made the coin?<br>
- some math operations<br>
 
5) Next, I added a few more things to collide with, and started Levels<br>
I added in "Levels" so the game got harder.<br>
Health can keep the game going longer, because it's now harder<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18734141
However, ending the game is incomplete in this version

6) Even more interesting touches<br>
Make the art more St Patricks Day-like.<br>
A working Health system + game over is implemented.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19057264<br>
Topic: sound tools.  play, import, edit.<br>
suggestion: super coins, slow the scroll, mines/spikes to avoid

7) Improve the score system
That orange box is ugly.  We can do better<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19060278
Talk about math operations

8) A better way to make a platform.

9) Refactoring
That score logic started to get spread out too much.  I fixed that.
The level logic is still spread out too much.  Fix that.<br>

10) future suggestions: 
- add in platforms
- add in coin generation better than 'random' (patterns like lines or arcs)
- add in a 'slow the march down'
- add in the ability to move forward and back a bit
