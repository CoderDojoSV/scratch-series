CoderDojo Scratch Series week 5
========================

##Ice Breaker: Dogde 'Em! <br> https://github.com/CoderDojoSV/scratch-series/blob/master/week-5/DodgeEm.pdf

#Tonight
We'll continue development of last week's project of a platform game. <br>

##Where we got to
We made it through Steps 1-3, so I will only mention recent changes in this readme.<br>	
You can refer to last week's at https://github.com/CoderDojoSV/scratch-series/blob/master/week-4/readme.md

What did we do last week?<br>
####1. an interesting background.  <br>
I am changing it to something more reminiscent of <b>St Patrick's Day</b>

####2. A physics engine including ground and gravity.<br>
We looked at my gravity system, and later tonight, I'll show someone else's with more features.

####3. Add in movement keys <br>
Some kids added right/left keys.  Some might want to change the way up arrow boosts.

####4. You win a Prize 
Add in things to collide with.  Coins, for one.<br> http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18684721<br>

##Where we're going
We just started with prizes last week, and we'll add more to the game now<br>

`Topic: 3d art: Want to know how I made the coin?`
 
###5. More Prizes, More Levels
Bouncing and collecting coins is not interesting for long.<br>
Next, I added more things to collect and added code for Levels<br>
I added Shamrocks, Stars, Hearts<br>
I added in "Levels" so the game got harder.<br>
Health can keep the game going longer, because it's now harder<br>

Coding time!| |
--|--
5 minute challenge|What would you do to finish up 'Game Over'

####6. St. Patricks Day<br>
Make the art more St Patricks Day-like.<br>
A working Health system + game over is implemented in
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19057264<br>

`Topic: sound tools.  play, import, edit.`

|Challenge|:Level|
|--|--|
|Change the star to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (CCGGAAG)|Easy|
|Add in an obstacle to avoid.  <br>https://www.google.com/search?q=clipart+bomb |Medium|
|Add in a prize that slows the game down|Medium|

####7. A better way to make a platform.
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19015667<br>
This very readable project implements the ability to<br>
roll up-hill without having to jump.

####8. Improve the score system
That orange box is ugly.  We can do better<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19060278
`Topic:math operations`


####9. Refactoring
That score logic started to get spread out too much.  I fixed that.<br>
The level logic is still spread out too much.  Fix that.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19073212


####10. future suggestions: 
- add in platforms to jump on
- add in coin generation better than 'random' (patterns like lines or arcs)
- add in a 'slow the scrolling down'
- add in the ability to move forward and back a bit

##Feedback: 
I appreciate your feedback from the survey!  Let's do it again!<br>
I would love continued feedback: http://goo.gl/tcZRB3
