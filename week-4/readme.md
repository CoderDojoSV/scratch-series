CoderDojo Scratch Series week 4
========================

I appreciate your feedback from the survey!  Let's do it again!
I would love continued feedback: http://goo.gl/tcZRB3

A fairly common thread in your responses was a wish to explore more platform games.<br>
I think we may do this over the next couple of weeks.

Some things that come to mind for an enjoyable platform game are 
1) an interesting background.  So, I picked a parallax-view scrolling background I liked<br>
not http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388  Todo: find original.

2) A platform.  I went a little crazy and made a bouncing platform.  <br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388<br>
- talk a bit about 'gravity'<br>
- talk about 'touching' fail<br>
- talk about logical operation OR 
- talk about logical operation (<= === !(>) )
- talk about DeMorgan's Law (  "a OR b" is the same as "not 'a AND b'"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws

3) adding in boost-by-keys<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18674756<br>
- suggest graphic improvements for ball. <br>

4) adding in something to collide with<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18684721<br>
- how I made the coin<br>
- some math operations<br>
- sound<br>
 
5) making a game of it.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18706424<br>
- lots more math operations<br>
- game design.<br>

6) future suggestions: 
- finish up the 'health' dropping to zero means game over
- add in platforms
- add in coin generation better than 'random' (patterns like lines or arcs)
- add in a diamond for 'more health'
- add in a super coin
- add in a 'slow the march down'
- add in the ability to move forward and back a bit
