# Tonight
I appreciate your feedback from the survey!  Let's do it again!<br>
I love continued feedback: http://goo.gl/tcZRB3
###You wanted a platform-style game


## no PowerPoint!
I'm trying to keep Scratch up in another window all the time

## Writing a platform game<br>
I added evolutionary steps.  Look at <br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/353977<br>
A fairly common thread in your responses was a wish to explore more platform games.<br>
We will do this over the next couple of weeks.

Some things that come to mind for an enjoyable platform game are <br>
###1) an interesting background. <br>
So, I picked a parallax-view scrolling background I liked<br>
look in http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388 <br> 
- layers <br>
- talk about move vs slide <br> 

Explore: 
- Explore how it works by changing the size<br>
- add a 3rd thing to slide by. <br>
- change back layer or mid layer to different art  
suggestion: Mardi gras.  St Patricks.  Spring.
suggest: search for tile graphic 

###2) A Heavy Topic.  (gravity)  
I went a little crazy and made a bouncing platform.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388<br>
- talk a bit about 'gravity'<br> 
- talk about 'touching' fail<br>
- talk about logical operation OR.  Important point: it's not exclusive.<br> 
- talk about logical operation (<= === !(>) )<br>
- talk about DeMorgan's Law (  "a OR b" is the same as "not 'a AND b'"<br>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws

Explore:
+ try changing constants, like Gravity and bounciness
+ advanced- try 'touching' vs 'y value test' 
+ If you get it back, then ball totation is easier)

2a) challenge
change what the ball bounces on 
+ advanced suggestion: use a (rounded paddle and introduce "angle of reflection??")
+ this makes a basis for 'a real platformer'


###3) Doing something with keys
####3a: First, add in "rocket boost"<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18674756<br>
- suggest: graphic improvements for ball. (rocket flame) <br>
- what other keys do you want?  "Air brakes" 
- I never tried "forward" and "back"

###4) adding in something to collide with<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18684721<br>
- how I made the coin<br>
- some math operations<br>
- sound<br>
 
###5) making an interesting game of it.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18706424<br>
- lots more math operations<br>
- game design.<br>

###6) future suggestions: 
- finish up the 'health' dropping to zero means game over
- add in platforms
- add in coin generation better than 'random' (patterns like lines or arcs)
- add in a diamond for 'more health'
- add in a super coin
- add in a 'slow the march down'
- add in the ability to move forward and back a bit
