Ice Breaker: Spend it All!  http://goo.gl/kK0XT8 <br>
Want a 6-sided die to roll?  http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18787185/

I appreciate your feedback from the survey!  Let's do it again!<br>
I would love continued feedback: http://goo.gl/tcZRB3

A fairly common thread in your responses was a wish to explore more platform games.<br>
We will do this over the next couple of weeks.

Some things that come to mind for an enjoyable platform game are 
1) an interesting background.  So, I picked a parallax-view scrolling background I liked<br>
look in http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388 <br> 
- talk about layers <br>
- talk about move vs slide <br> 

Explore: 
+ Explore how it works by changing the size<br>
+ add a 3rd thing to slide by. <br>
+ change back layer or mid layer to different art  
suggestion: Mardi gras.  St Patricks.  Spring.
suggest: search for tile graphic 

2) A platform.  I went a little crazy and made a bouncing platform.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17398388<br>
- talk a bit about 'gravity'<br> 
- talk about 'touching' fail<br>
- talk about logical operation OR.  Important point: it's not exclusive.<br> 
- talk about logical operation (<= === !(>) )<br>
- talk about DeMorgan's Law (  "a OR b" is the same as "not 'a AND b'"<br>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws

Explore:
+ change constants
+ advanced- try touching vs y test (and get ball rotation back)

2a) challenge
change what the ball bounces on (rounded paddle and introduce "angle of reflection??")


3) adding in boost-by-keys<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18674756<br>
- suggest graphic improvements for ball. <br>

4) adding in something to collide with<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18684721<br>
- how I made the coin<br>
- some math operations<br>
- sound<br>
 
5) making a game of it.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/18706424<br>
- lots more math operations<br>
- game design.<br>

6) future suggestions: 
- finish up the 'health' dropping to zero means game over
- add in platforms
- add in coin generation better than 'random' (patterns like lines or arcs)
- add in a diamond for 'more health'
- add in a super coin
- add in a 'slow the march down'
- add in the ability to move forward and back a bit
