#Week 6, the Final Week

##A little bit of Computer Science in Scratch
- Nested Loops<br>
Talk about this via presentation.<br>
Challenge: "Point Towards Me" puzzle at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19402003<br>
Finished at: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19401398

- Distance formula<br>
Talk about this via presentation.<br>
Demo: changing the arrow size at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19366976<br>
Challenge: use 'distance' to do other effects (Ghost, inverse size, color shift, ...)<br>

##Scratch: More Resources
http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/ScratchTastic<br>
- be aware that most activities on the kata are for scratch 1.4.  
- in particular, the 'mesh' feature is cool but needs 1.4

http://LearnScratch.org  (particularly "Book 3")<br>
- also scratch 1.4
- not always the best solution.

Scratch Extensions - adding features to Scratch
- Typically adds new blocks
- Control a Lego Mindstorm Robot
- Use android as a controller with Scratcher Centroller (YMMV-anti-virus/firewall cripples it)

#Scratch-like alternatives
####App Inventor, also from MIT<br>
A scratch-like programming tool for making "real world" android apps<br>
demo<br>

####Snap.berkeley.edu: first to work only in a browser, also works on tablets<br>

####Blockly: used in hour of code.  It's a project by Google people, and may grow to AppInventor-like abilities



#A plug for Web development classes
If you're feeling like you've had enough 'Scratch' lessons, consider Web Development!
Example: http://codepen.io/jimwhitfield/details/Imbkx/ <br>
#### HTML - text and structure
#### CSS - appearance
#### JavaScript - like 'blocks' in Scratch, but usually with typing<br>

Khan Academy has great resources for learning JavaScript (and the developer volunteers for CoderDojoSV)

#Follow-on offerings
The Spring class line-up is not settled yet.  It's likely to be a 4 week session.  
Scratch isn't currently planned.  Web development and Python are very likely.<br>

On Scratch.mit.edu, I'm jamwave.  I'll reply to comments you leave on my profile<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/users/jamwave/
If you add a project to CoderDojoSV sharing, I'll take a look at it.<br>
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/353977/<br>

Maybe "Office hours" via Google Helpout. (I'll aim for next week Tuesday at 7pm). If I do, look for a comment on my Scratch profile.  It's an interesting idea, but we don't know if it will work out.<br>
