#Scratch-like alternatives
App Inventor, also from MIT<br>
Scratch-like programming for "the real world" of android<br>

Snap.berkeley.edu: first to work only in a browser, also works on tablets
<br>

Blockly: used in hour of code.  It's a project by Google people, and may grow to AppInventor-like abilities



#A plug for Web development classes
If you're feeling like you've had enough 'scratch' lessons, consider Web Development!
#### HTML - text and structure
#### CSS - appearance
#### Javascript - like 'blocks' in Scratch, but usually with typing
